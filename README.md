# Web-development-1-exam
DS3101 - Fall 2019

This is an exam assignment where the goal was to create a website for the employee of "Politiets sikkerhetstjeneste" in Norway.
The task consisted of creating two html pages. 
The first page shows an overview of all cases, a detail button that shows details of each case and a function that changes the status of the cases (resolved / not resolved).
The other page is an admin page, where cases can be edited, deleted and created.
